# pmuens:skeleton
This package wraps the popular [Skeleton responsive boilerplate](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton) into a meteor package. It uses [git submodules](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule) so that it can be easily updated to newer versions.

## Installation
Simply run `meteor add pmuens:skeleton` and you are up and running.

## Contributions
If you'd like to contribute (which I would welcome!) simply send a PR.
